Module 1 Challenge


<!-- User Story -->
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<!-- Acceptance Criteria -->
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 👌
                    <!-- confirmed the source file uses some semantic HTML elements -->
                    <!-- broke HTML out into additional semantic elements for better design
                    Nav
                    Figure
                    Section
                    Aside
                    Footer -->
                    <!-- div and span remaining are intentional as changing to other semantic elements 
                    did not yield desired results -->

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 👌
                    <!-- i don't find anything inherently wrong with the order of elements as-is. 
                    the order is logical to me -->
                    <!-- noting the CSS needs cleaning up, this prompt is for HTML so I assume
                    CSS order, comments, and condensing is separate -->

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes 👌
                    <!-- added these to 6 images. -->
                    <!-- not possible to add this to the css background image -->

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order 👌
                    <!-- footer updated to h4 -->

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title 👌
                    <!-- Changed this to Horiseon SSS (for Social Solution Services), Inc. -->
